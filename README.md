# Smart_Parking_System
# üöó IoT-Based Car Parking System

An automated smart parking system designed using **Arduino Uno**, **IR sensors**, **a servo motor**, and an **I2C LCD display**. This project helps efficiently manage limited parking spaces by detecting vehicle entry and exit, updating availability in real time, and controlling access through a motorized gate.

## üß† How It Works

1. **IR Sensor 1** detects a car at the **entry gate**.
   - If space is available:
     - Servo gate opens.
     - Available space count is reduced by 1.
   - If no space is available:
     - "No Space Available" is displayed on the LCD.

2. **IR Sensor 2** detects a car at the **exit**.
   - Servo gate opens.
   - Available space count increases by 1.

3. **16x2 LCD** displays:
   - Total parking slots
   - Currently available slots
